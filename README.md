# Libre Commander (lc)

A fast, Rust-based file manager inspired by Midnight Commander.

## Features

- **Dual-panel interface** - Navigate and manage files in two panels side-by-side
- **Async file operations** - Copy, move, delete, rename, chmod files and directories with background progress and cancellation
- **Safe recursive copy/move/delete** - Handles directories with symlink preservation, no-clobber copy, cross-device fallback, partial-copy cleanup, and cancellation safeguards
- **Advanced search** - Incremental panel filter, recursive file search (glob patterns), content search (grep-like)
- **File viewer** - Built-in text viewer with search, hex dump, line numbers, and word wrap
- **Directory tree** - Interactive expandable directory tree view
- **Directory compare** - Compare panels by name, size, or modification time (3 modes)
- **Directory hotlist** - Bookmark directories for quick access via Alt+1 through Alt+9
- **Directory history** - Navigate back with Alt+Backspace
- **User menu** - Extensible menu system via `.mc.menu` or `~/.config/lc/menu` (MC-compatible)
- **Sorting** - 12 sort modes: by name (standard & natural), size, modification time, creation time, or extension (ascending/descending)
- **File watcher** - Automatic panel refresh on external filesystem changes while preserving filters, sorting, and selection
- **Panel views** - Long (detailed) and Brief (compact) listing modes
- **File type icons** - Emoji icons and color coding for archives, images, source code, audio, video, config files
- **Mouse support** - Single click to select, double click to open/view, click to switch panels
- **Keyboard-driven** - 45+ keyboard shortcuts for power users
- **Configurable** - Customizable settings stored in `~/.config/lc/config.toml`
- **System protection** - Refuses to delete critical system directories (`/`, `/etc`, `/usr`, etc.)

## Configuration

Configuration file location: `~/.config/lc/config.toml`

### Config Schema

```toml
active_panel = "left"  # "left" or "right"
dir_first = true       # directories before files in sort
sort_sensitive = false # case-sensitive name sorting

[left]
path = "/home/user"
show_hidden = true
show_permissions = false
listing_mode = "long"  # "long" or "brief"
sort_mode = "name_asc" # see sort modes below
filter = ""            # glob pattern, empty = no filter

[right]
path = "/home/user/projects"
show_hidden = true
show_permissions = false
listing_mode = "long"
sort_mode = "name_asc"
filter = ""

hotlist = ["/home/user", "/home/user/projects"]
```

### Sort Modes

`name_asc`, `name_desc`, `natural_name_asc`, `natural_name_desc`, `size_asc`, `size_desc`, `mod_time_asc`, `mod_time_desc`, `btime_asc`, `btime_desc`, `extension_asc`, `extension_desc`

An optional `[theme]` section is supported for color customization; all fields have defaults.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `EDITOR` | External editor for F4 | `vi` |
| `HOME` | Config/menu file location | (required) |
| `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` | Config/menu file base directory | `$HOME/.config` |

## User Menu

Create custom menu entries in:
- Local: `.mc.menu` in the active panel's directory
- Global: `~/.config/lc/menu`

### Menu Format

```
# Comment line

+ f \.rs$
T  Run Rust tests
	cargo test %f

+ f \.py$
R  Run Python script
	python3 %f

A  Archive selected files
	tar czf archive.tgz %t

D  Diff panels
	diff -rq %d %D
```

### Entry Structure

- **Hotkey**: First character of the line (single char)
- **Title**: Rest of the hotkey line (display label)
- **Body**: Indented lines (tab or space) as shell commands
- **Condition**: `+ f <regex>` — only show entry when filename matches regex; multiple condition lines are OR'd together. Conditions can appear before or after the hotkey line.

### Substitution Tokens

| Token | Expands to |
|-------|------------|
| `%f` | Current filename (shell-quoted) |
| `%d` | Active panel directory (shell-quoted) |
| `%D` | Other panel directory (shell-quoted) |
| `%t` / `%s` | Tagged/selected files (space-separated, shell-quoted); `%s` is an alias for `%t` |
| `%%` | Literal `%` |

Commands are executed via `sh -c` with the active panel's directory as working directory.

Menu files are limited to 1 MiB.

## File Operations

Long-running copy, move, and delete operations run as background jobs with live item and byte progress. Operations can be canceled between safe boundaries; move operations finish cleanup after a successful cross-device copy so source and destination do not diverge unexpectedly.

Safety guarantees:

- Existing destinations are not overwritten by chunked copies.
- Recursive directory copies publish through a temporary sibling and clean up partial output on failure or cancellation.
- Symlinks are copied or deleted as symlinks rather than following their targets.
- Cross-device moves fall back to copy-then-delete only after the copy succeeds.
- Critical system directories are protected from deletion.

## File Viewer

The built-in viewer (F3) supports:

- **Text mode** with word wrap (toggle with `w`)
- **Line numbers** (toggle with `l`)
- **Hex dump** (toggle with `h`) — standard hex+offset format, 16 bytes per line
- **In-file search** (`/` to search, `n`/`N` to navigate matches)
- **Horizontal scrolling** for wide lines
- **Unicode support** — lossy UTF-8 display for binary files
- **Size limit** — files up to 100 MiB (larger files are truncated)
- **Content detection** — auto-detection of text vs binary content (MIME-based with null-byte fallback)

## Search

### Incremental Search (Panel Filter)

Type any character in normal mode to start filtering. The panel updates in real-time. Supports glob patterns (`*`, `?`). Case-insensitive.

### File Search (Find File)

Menu: Command > Find file. Recursive glob-pattern search from the active panel's directory. First match is navigated to automatically.

### Content Search

Available programmatically via `FileSearch::search_content()`. Searches file contents line-by-line. Case-insensitive. Content search limits: files over 10 MiB skipped, lines over 64 KiB skipped, max 1000 results, max depth 20, max 10000 items scanned. Not yet wired to a UI action.

## Sorting

Twelve sort modes, cycled via menu (Left/Right > Sort order):

| Mode | Key | Order |
|------|-----|-------|
| Name ↑ | name_asc | A-Z |
| Name ↓ | name_desc | Z-A |
| Nat ↑ | natural_name_asc | A-Z (digit-aware) |
| Nat ↓ | natural_name_desc | Z-A (digit-aware) |
| Size ↑ | size_asc | Smallest first |
| Size ↓ | size_desc | Largest first |
| Time ↑ | mod_time_asc | Oldest first |
| Time ↓ | mod_time_desc | Newest first |
| Created ↑ | btime_asc | Oldest first |
| Created ↓ | btime_desc | Newest first |
| Ext ↑ | extension_asc | A-Z |
| Ext ↓ | extension_desc | Z-A |

Rules: `..` always first, directories before files, case-insensitive. These defaults are configurable via `dir_first` and `sort_sensitive` in `config.toml`. Natural sort compares multi-digit runs numerically (e.g. `file9` < `file10`).

## Directory Compare

Command menu > Compare dirs. Three modes:

| Mode | Matching criteria |
|------|-------------------|
| Quick | Filename + entry type |
| Size | Filename + size (dirs: name + type only) |
| Thorough | Filename + size + modification time (dirs: name + type only) |

Differing and unique entries are auto-selected in both panels.

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
cargo test
```

The test suite covers:
- File operations (copy, move, delete, rename, chmod)
- Search (incremental, glob, content, symlink safety)
- Sorting (all 12 modes, edge cases)
- UI rendering (colors, icons, formatting, truncation)
- Config persistence (roundtrip serialization)
- User menu parsing and substitution
- Directory tree building and toggling
- Viewer (scroll, search, hex mode, Unicode)
- Batch operations (copy/move/delete with progress and cancellation)
- File watcher events and debouncing

## Quality Gates

Run these checks before submitting changes:

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test
```

File operations include safety guards: system directories are protected from deletion, symlinks are handled correctly during copy/move/delete, and terminal state is always restored (even on panic).
